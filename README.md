# Valorant Bot
This bot was in the works for months till I finally decieded to make it open source, this is for the people that want to contribute to this bot, and hopefully see some cool integrations from other people.

## Installation

1. Install the latest NON-DEV Tesseract OCR  from the link [here](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/).
2. Create a folder named "images" in your C:/ directory, containing 2 images named not_dm.png and is_dm.png.
3. images should look something like these ![image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/822267864358322187/822269664276774932/not_dm.png) and ![image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/822267864358322187/822269666285191188/is_dm.png) respectivley.
4. Open Valorant and press F11 on the game to switch to windowed mode, keep in mind to not move the window anywhere but its default spot which is in the center
5. Click play to navigate to the game mode options and just start the bot from there
